# ZIG MACHINE LEARNIN LIB PROJECT "Ballin":
 While I am trying to learn zig I plan to use this knowlegde to make basics of the zigs liblary to use it in matrix multiplications and machine learning later while progress goes. 
 This is a basic outline of the development plan for Ballin:

## Current State: 
**The library currently has a basic structure and a few functions implemented.**

## Short-Term Goals:
* Implement more machine learning algorithms (e.g. decision trees, clustering)
* Add support for more data types (e.g. images, text)
* Improve the documentation and examples
## Mid-Term Goals:
* Implement a more robust and efficient data structure for the dataset
* Add support for parallel processing and GPU acceleration
* Implement a simple neural network
## Long-Term Goals:
* Implement a more advanced neural network architecture (e.g. convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks)
* Add support for more advanced machine learning techniques (e.g. transfer learning, attention mechanisms)
* Improve the performance and scalability of the library
## What I've Implemented So Far

#What Needs to be Implemented

**There are many things that still need to be implemented, including:**

* More machine learning algorithms
* Support for more data types
* A more robust and efficient data structure for the dataset
* Parallel processing and GPU acceleration
* A simple neural network
* More advanced machine learning techniques
* How to Contribute

note that its just a plan for project and even tho I'm feel pasionate about it it may be to difficult for me.
